## Description

`@koolie` is a platform designed to reduce the time and effort required to build production-ready Typescript applications. While its primary focus is on the development of microservices and APIs, the platform can assist all types of applications regardless of their size and complexity.

It consists of a collection of Typescript packages that can be included into applications to perform the heavy lifting in tasks such as:

- graceful application startup and shutdown
- application configuration loading
- application logging
- database interfaces and query building
- defining and implementing APIs including auto-generation of Swagger and OpenAPI v3 specifications
- management of the Typescript toolset and 3rd-party packages

This modular approach allows applications to include as much or as little of the platform as they require.
